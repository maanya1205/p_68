The classroom has 1 chair and 1 table for each student.The playground is like a football field(basically really big!). Their are many slides and swings and there is a seperate area for playing basketball! The canteen food is more than delectable! from class 3 till class 4, there are around total 9-10 subjects and from 5 till 7 you have 2-3 extra subjects.From class 8 to class 12, you have around 12 subjects. </p>

        <h1>Aditi Das

            Aditi Das from the batch of 2009 is on her way to Northumbria University, in the United Kingdom, where she will be pursuing her PhD in Social Geography (The Delhi Eateries). She previously presented interesting papers titled Colonial Foodscape of Kolkata (in Copenhagen) and An Ethnographic study of Bengal Public Dining in Kolkata(at a conference in London’s Imperial College). Just prior to her departure she conducted an interactive session with the Geography Students of Classes XI & XII on the scope of the subject and the nuances of Geography.

            Stamp Issued in Honour of Alumna

            Alokananda Roy,an ex student who has been felicitated and an ex teacher from 1974 -1981.

            It was a proud moment indeed when a stamp was issued in Alokananda Roy’s name by the West Bengal Postal Circle in August 2019. This was to pay tribute to her innovative & heroic efforts (through the medium of dance & music), which changed the mindset of Correctional Home inmates across the state of West Bengal !
